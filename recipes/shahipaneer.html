If you are in a hurry, you can also use tomato puree instead of chopped tomatoes. To make this recipe more delicious, you can dry roast the spices seperately and then add them to the gravy. This will make your recipe more aromatic. Now, grind cashews and almonds seperately using a little water and make cashew and almond paste. Keep them aside until required.</li>
            <li>Prepare onion-tomato gravy using curd
                <br>
                Next, put a pan on medium flame and heat 3 tablespoon of ghee in it. Add the chopped onions, ginger, green chillies along with green cardamoms for 4-5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cover the pan with lid. Cook for about 8-10 minutes. Then, add the beaten curd, cook for another 5 minutes and pour a cup of water into the pan. Cook for another 2 minutes. When the gravy is cooked, let it cool down at room temperature. When it's cool enough, add it to a mixer jar and blend till smooth and keep aside</li>
            <li>Add paneer cubes in the gravy and cook for 3-5 minutes
                <br>
                Now, heat the remaining ghee in another pan and add the ground gravy in it along with red chilli powder, a garam masala powder, cashew and almond paste along with salt. Bring it to a boil or till gravy thickens. Then add the paneer cubes and milk. Cook for another 3-5 minutes.
