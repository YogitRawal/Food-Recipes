            <li>Saute the ingredients until the oil starts separating from the mixture. Add heavy cream and simmer for 5 mins until the sauce is thickened. Add the broiled chicken pieces to the sauce. Simmer for another 5-6 minutes until chicken is mixed with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once done, transfer the dish to a serving bowl and garnish with fresh mint leaves. With rich tomato gravy and tandoori flavours, this chicken recipe goes really well with the bread of all kinds such as naans, rumali rotis and even tandoori chapatis.</li>
            <li>Use chicken thighs for flavour and succulence. Marinate it properly because the longer you marinate the chicken meat, the better it tastes. Make sure the spices you use are fresh and aren't too old. When you are finished making the recipe, season with Garam masala for delicious taste. 3. Use ghee or butter for the richness of flavour. Grill your meat because it is evenly charred and tender than others.</li>
